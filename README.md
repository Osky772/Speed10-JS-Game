# Javascript project game

This game is my first big project made in Javascript from scratch. 
I created all functionallity on my own. 
I know that code in script.js is not clean, it is "bad code". 
When I was coding this game I didn't know the rules of clean coding.
Now I see that bad practice but I am not going to refactor the whole game. 
In this project I wanted to make this thing working and that was my main goal.
